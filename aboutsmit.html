    <H1>Mission Statement</H1>
    Saylani Welfare Trust understands the importance and significance of education which is why the organization has
    dedicated itself to providing basic quality education to the underprivileged children of Pakistan. Just as education
    is essential for the upbringing of the children, ethical values and knowledge also play a major role in shaping
    their lives and helping them in developing a sense of responsibility, ownership, and civic responsibility so that
    they can grow up to be proud citizens of Pakistan. Saylani Welfare Trust also believes in supporting teachers and
    helping them in developing leadership qualities as an asset to the community.

        <b>Vision :</b>
        As of now, 32,000 students are currently enrolled in our schools across Sindh. We, at Saylani Welfare Trust, aim
        to
        send 100,000 out-of-school children to schools by 2025.

    "We are the link between donors and those who require support. Our intention has been to collect and spend in
    underprivileged areas. Our area of focus is education for the simple reason that nation-building is achieved through
    quality education. Education through books only is not our goal; we strive to make our students a healthy part of
    society. We do all this under the banner of Saylani Welfare Trust which was established in 1994. Our history is 28
    years of success and celebrations. We at Saylani Welfare Trust make efforts to expand the schooling system in less
    developed areas to serve people for their bright future."
